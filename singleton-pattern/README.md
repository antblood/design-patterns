# Singleton Design Pattern in Go

## What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Why is Singleton Design Pattern Good?

- **Controlled Access**: A Singleton provides a single point of access to the instance, which can be useful for managing shared resources, such as configuration settings or connection pools.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The Singleton instance can be created when it is first needed, rather than at application startup, which can be beneficial for optimizing resource usage.
- **Global State Management**: It allows for the easy sharing of state across different parts of an application.

## Cons of Singleton Pattern

- **Global State**: Singleton introduces global state into an application, which can make debugging and testing challenging due to hidden dependencies.
- **Concurrency Issues**: If not implemented carefully, Singleton can lead to concurrency issues in multi-threaded environments.
- **Difficult to Extend**: Singleton can make it difficult to subclass or extend functionality due to its nature of having a single instance.

## Explanation of the Provided Code

The provided code demonstrates a basic implementation of the Singleton pattern in Go using the `sync.Once` construct:

- **`sync.Once`**: Ensures that the Singleton instance is initialized only once, even in the presence of multiple goroutines.
- **`GetInstance` function**: Provides access to the Singleton instance. It initializes the instance on the first call and returns the same instance for subsequent calls.
- **`Singleton struct`**: Represents the Singleton object with some dummy data for demonstration.

## Handling Singleton with FX

The fx framework can be used to manage Singletons by taking advantage of its dependency injection capabilities.

Advantage of using fx: - **Global state**: The fx framework can be used to manage global state across an application and this variable won't get updated.
